<h5>• Keynote:  Urgent Computing with AI@Edge</h5>
  <h6>Speaker: Pete Beckman, Northwestern University / Argonne National Labs </h6>


<p> <em> Abstract: From the sensor to the supercomputer, scientific discovery is part of a connected digital continuum that is dynamic and fast. In this new digital continuum, Artificial intelligence (AI) is providing tremendous breakthroughs, making data analysis and automated real-time responses possible across the digital continuum. Sage is a National Science Foundation funded project to build a national cyberinfrastructure for programmable edge computing. This new edge computing programming framework gives scientists a new tool for exploring the impacts of global urbanization, natural disasters such as flooding and wildfires, and climate change on natural ecosystems and city infrastructure. The Sage infrastructure allows scientists to analyze
data in situ, at the edge, at the highest resolution of data. Data from the edge computation are then transmitted to a cloud computing infrastructure where they can be archived and provided to the community as data products or used in real-time to trigger computational models or dynamically modify subsequent edge computation. This new edge computing programming framework gives scientists a new tool for exploring the impacts of global urbanization, natural disasters such as flooding and wildfires, and climate change on natural ecosystems and city infrastructure. Sage is deploying cyberinfrastructure in environmental test-beds in California, Montana, Colorado, and Kansas, in the National Ecological Observatory Network, and in urban environments in Illinois and Texas. </em> </p>
