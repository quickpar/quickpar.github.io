### Overview

Urgent Computing refers to a class of scientific applications that enable important decision-making under time and quality constraints while maintaining desired confidence. Urgent Computing's overarching goal is to predict the outcome of scenarios early enough to prevent critical situations or mitigate their negative consequences.

This workshop seeks scientific contributions that leverage the aggregation of heterogeneous resources along the data path from the Edge to the Cloud/HPC, also known as the Computing Continuum, to support critical analytics applications. Data-driven dynamic workflows, which combine knowledge from multiple data sources and integrate it on-demand with distributed, large-scale computational models, are some of the canonical use cases for this theme.
