### Overview

Urgent Computing refers to a class of time-critical scientific applications that leverage distributed data sources to facilitate important decision-making in a timely manner. The overall goal of Urgent Computing is to predict the outcome of scenarios early enough to prevent critical situations or to mitigate their negative consequences.

This workshop aims at scientific contributions that leverage the aggregation of heterogeneous resources along the data path from the Edge to the Cloud/HPC, also referred to as the Computing Continuum, for supporting urgent analytics applications. The canonical use cases for this work are data-driven dynamic workflows, which combine knowledge from multiple data sources and integrate it on-demand with distributed, large-scale computational models.
